      "\n",
      "<p>What's this exciting new position about? Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n",

      "<h3>The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\n",

      "</li>\n",
      "<li>On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/\">Svelte</a></strong>. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.</li>\n",
      "<li>We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We’re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\n",
      "</li>\n",
      "</ul><h3>What the \"client-facing\" part entails:</h3>\n",

      "<ul>\n",

      "<li>That means we're looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\n",
      "<li>\n",
      "<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\n",
      "<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\n",
      "<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\n",

We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p></li>\n",
      "<li><p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We're looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p></li>\n",
      "<li><p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p></li>\n",
